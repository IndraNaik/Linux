# Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers

## What is Kernel?

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

## What is Shell?

A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for users to interact with operating system services. It accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into instructions that the kernel can understand. The shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. It starts when the user logs in or opens a terminal.

## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

Linux shell scripting involves writing programs (scripts) that can be run by a Linux shell, such as bash (Bourne Again Shell). These scripts automate tasks, perform system administration tasks, and facilitate the interaction between users and the operating system.
